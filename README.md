# project_badass

A little sumpin' sumpin' to track our NFL league progress.

## the_api

@eboblick found an API we can access for free up to 100 times per day, per user. This API can be found at: https://rapidapi.com/tank01/api/tank01-nfl-live-in-game-real-time-statistics-nfl/. 

## the_secret_folder

The .gitignore file is set to not commit anything inside the secret folder at the root of this repo. You can make a text file api_key.txt inside of the secret folder to store your super secret API key. This key is used to, well, access the API.

## the_powershell

To start off, @eboblick wrote a Powershell script to query the API and tally up the league's scores. @thedavidholt went crazy one night, stayed up wayyyy too late, injected the script with steroids, and then couldn't sleep.

## the_future

Moving forward, we would like to build a web stack to query and present this data in a very pretty way. It's gonna be a beaut, I tell ya!
